# MRCF-Net
Data Preprocessing
Please follow the tips to download the processed datasets and pre-trained model:

Download RGB-D SOD dataset and pretrained backbone weights from [https://pan.baidu.com/s/16i-QKAfPXhrcm6HwQhb2Lw?pwd=0521], code: 0521.

Training command :python train.py

Testing command :The trained model for MRCF can be download here:[https://pan.baidu.com/s/16i-QKAfPXhrcm6HwQhb2Lw?pwd=0521], code: 0521.

Evaluation:We implement three metrics: MAE (Mean Absolute Error), F-Measure, S-Measure. We use Toolkit [(https://github.com/zyjwuyan/SOD_Evaluation_Metrics)] to obtain the test metrics.

Results:Qualitative results: we provide the saliency maps, you can download them from [https://pan.baidu.com/s/16i-QKAfPXhrcm6HwQhb2Lw?pwd=0521], code: 0521.
